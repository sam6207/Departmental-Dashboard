# Departmental-Dashboard
Department Dashboard system with leave approval, pending timer, auto-reject logic, and attendance history management.
Student Leaving Management System is a group-based web application designed to manage student leave requests efficiently.
The system provides separate dashboards for departments and administrators to review, approve, reject, or keep leave requests pending, along with attendance tracking and request history management.

I worked on the Department Dashboard, focusing on leave approval workflows, request status management, and user-friendly UI.
